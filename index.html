            <h1>Non-Medical Determinants of Health</h1>
            <p>This project is designed specifically for university students pursuing degrees in public health,
                sociology, environmental studies, and data science. Through the use of comprehensive data
                visualizations, our goal is to provide a deep understanding of the non-medical determinants of health.
                These visualizations explore the intricate relationships and trends within various health-related data
                sets, offering students a practical, engaging, and educational experience.

            <h3>Purpose of the Visualizations</h3>
            <p>The visualizations in this project serve to illuminate the complex dynamics of health determinants
                through three main types of analysis:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Time Series Analysis
                    <ul>
                        <li>Explore how tobacco and alcohol consumption have evolved over the years and investigate the
                            factors influencing these trends.</li>
                        <li>Examine changes in nutritional intake over time and assess how these changes align with
                            recommended dietary guidelines.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li>Correlation Visualizations
                    <ul>
                        <li>Investigate the relationship between tobacco and alcohol consumption and health outcomes,
                            analyzing how these relationships vary over time and across different demographics.
                        </li>
                        <li>Delve into the correlations between nutritional intake and obesity rates, exploring
                            variations by year and demographic factors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Comparative Analysis
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyze differences in health behaviors and outcomes across genders and over time, providing
                            insights into the impact of these disparities on public health.
                        </li>
                        <li>Review annual changes in key health indicators like smoking rates, alcohol consumption, and
                            obesity rates to gauge the effectiveness of public health interventions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
