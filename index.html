                    This project is designed specifically for university students pursuing degrees in public health,
                    sociology,
                    environmental studies, and data science. Through the use of comprehensive data visualizations, our
                    goal is
                    to provide a deep understanding of the non-medical determinants of health. These visualizations
                    explore the
                    intricate relationships and trends within various health-related data sets, offering students a
                    practical,

                    <h3>Educational Benefits</h3>
                    <p>By engaging with these visualizations, students can enhance their educational experience,
                        supporting
                        their coursework and research projects. The insights gained are designed to aid in
                        evidence-based
                        decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of the factors that influence public health.
                        This initiative not only benefits individual learning but also contributes to the broader
                        academic
                        community by providing valuable data and insights that can influence future public health
                        policies and
                        interventions.</p>

            <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The chart aims to compare critical health factors over the last decade. These factors include the
                consumption of alcohol, tobacco, obesity, junk food, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Data Representation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>X-Axis: Represents time, labeled by years.</li>
                <li>Y-Axis: Represents the quantity of each factor, measured in grams per capita per day. The Y-axis
                    scale will change based on the factor being displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Line Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each line on the chart represents a different health factor, such as tobacco, alcohol, fruits,
                    vegetables, sugar, protein, calories, and vaping.</li>
                <li>The lines are color-coded to match the labels for each factor, helping differentiate between them.

                    <h3>Disease Covered</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pneumonia:</strong> Poor nutrition weakens immunity, increasing infection risks.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Malignant Neoplasms:</strong> Diets high in processed meats and alcohol increase
                            cancer risks, while fruits and vegetables lower them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diabetes Mellitus:</strong> High sugar and fat diets lead to type 2 diabetes;
                            healthy eating and weight management are crucial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diseases of the Circulatory System:</strong> High intake of unhealthy fats and
                            sodium raises heart disease risks; a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
                            reduces these risks.</li>

                    <h3>Proven Evidence</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> Diet influences weight, glycaemia, and cardiovascular
                            complications. Evidence supports diets high in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains for
                            diabetes management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cardiovascular Diseases:</strong> High intake of unhealthy fats and sodium is linked
                            to heart diseases. The Mediterranean diet, rich in healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables, is
                            beneficial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cancer:</strong> Diets high in processed meats and alcohol, and low in fruits and
                            vegetables, are associated with higher cancer risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Poor dietary choices lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for
                            many chronic diseases.</li>
