            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            This project is designed specifically for university students pursuing degrees in public health, sociology,
            environmental studies, and data science. Through the use of comprehensive data visualizations, our goal is
            to provide a deep understanding of the non-medical determinants of health. These visualizations explore the
            intricate relationships and trends within various health-related data sets, offering students a practical,
            engaging, and educational experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Educational Benefits</h3>
            <p>By engaging with these visualizations, students can enhance their educational experience, supporting
                their coursework and research projects. The insights gained are designed to aid in evidence-based
                decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of the factors that influence public health.
                This initiative not only benefits individual learning but also contributes to the broader academic
                community by providing valuable data and insights that can influence future public health policies and
                interventions.</p>

            <h2>Visualisation</h2>
            <h3>Purpose of the Visualizations</h3>
            <p>The visualizations in this project serve to illuminate the complex dynamics of health determinants
                through three main types of analysis:</p><br>
            <h4>1. Time Series Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore how tobacco and alcohol consumption have evolved over the years and investigate the
                    factors influencing these trends.</li>
                <li>Examine changes in nutritional intake over time and assess how these changes align with
                    recommended dietary guidelines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Correlation Visualizations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate the relationship between tobacco and alcohol consumption and health outcomes,
                    analyzing how these relationships vary over time and across different demographics.
                </li>
                <li>Delve into the correlations between nutritional intake and obesity rates, exploring
                    variations by year and demographic factors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Comparative Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze differences in health behaviors and outcomes across genders and over time, providing
                    insights into the impact of these disparities on public health.
                </li>
                <li>Review annual changes in key health indicators like smoking rates, alcohol consumption, and
                    obesity rates to gauge the effectiveness of public health interventions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The chart aims to compare critical health factors over the last decade. These factors include the
                consumption of alcohol, tobacco, obesity, junk food, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Data Representation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>X-Axis: Represents time, labeled by years.</li>
                <li>Y-Axis: Represents the quantity of each factor, measured in grams per capita per day. The Y-axis
                    scale will change based on the factor being displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Line Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each line on the chart represents a different health factor, such as tobacco, alcohol, fruits,
                    vegetables, sugar, protein, calories, and vaping.</li>
                <li>The lines are color-coded to match the labels for each factor, helping differentiate between them.

            <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                this sketch serves as a strategic plan for developing an interactive visualization tool that elucidates
                gender-specific trends in lifestyle choices. This tool aims to provide insights into how different
                lifestyle factors are adopted by men and women, potentially influencing targeted health interventions
                and policies.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Data Representation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>X-Axis: Represents different lifestyle factors (e.g., Alcohol, Fruits, Tobacco, Obesity).</li>
                <li>Indicates the level or frequency of these factors, potentially measured in units like servings,
                    cigarettes smoked, alcohol units consumed, or BMI categories.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Stacked Bar Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stacked Bars: Each bar in the chart is divided into segments that represent data for men and women.
                    This stacking approach allows for a direct comparison of how each gender engages with these
                    lifestyle factors.</li>
                <li>Color Coding: The bars are likely color-coded (e.g., yellow for men and blue for women) to easily
                    differentiate the data between genders.
                </li>
