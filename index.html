            <h1>Non-Medical Determinants of Health</h1>
            <p>This project is designed specifically for university students pursuing degrees in public health,
                sociology, environmental studies, and data science. Through the use of comprehensive data
                visualizations, our goal is to provide a deep understanding of the non-medical determinants of health.
                These visualizations explore the intricate relationships and trends within various health-related data
                sets, offering students a practical, engaging, and educational experience.

            <h2>Visualisation</h2>
            <h3>Purpose of the Visualizations</h3>
            <p>The visualizations in this project serve to illuminate the complex dynamics of health determinants
                through three main types of analysis:</p><br>
            <h4>1. Time Series Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore how tobacco and alcohol consumption have evolved over the years and investigate the
                    factors influencing these trends.</li>
                <li>Examine changes in nutritional intake over time and assess how these changes align with
                    recommended dietary guidelines.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Correlation Visualizations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate the relationship between tobacco and alcohol consumption and health outcomes,
                    analyzing how these relationships vary over time and across different demographics.
                </li>
                <li>Delve into the correlations between nutritional intake and obesity rates, exploring
                    variations by year and demographic factors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Comparative Analysis</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze differences in health behaviors and outcomes across genders and over time, providing
                    insights into the impact of these disparities on public health.
                </li>
                <li>Review annual changes in key health indicators like smoking rates, alcohol consumption, and
                    obesity rates to gauge the effectiveness of public health interventions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Trends in Health-Related Lifestyle Choices</h2>
            <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The chart aims to compare critical health factors over the last decade. These factors include the
                consumption of alcohol, tobacco, obesity, junk food, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Data Representation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>X-Axis: Represents time, labeled by years.</li>
                <li>Y-Axis: Represents the quantity of each factor, measured in grams per capita per day. The Y-axis
                    scale will change based on the factor being displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. Line Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each line on the chart represents a different health factor, such as tobacco, alcohol, fruits,
                    vegetables, sugar, protein, calories, and vaping.</li>
                <li>The lines are color-coded to match the labels for each factor, helping differentiate between them.
                </li>
